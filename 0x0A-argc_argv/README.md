What Are Command-Line Arguments?

Explain that command-line arguments are values passed to a program when it is run from the command line.
These arguments allow users to customize the behavior of the program without modifying its source code.
Accessing Command-Line Arguments

Describe how to access command-line arguments in a C program:
argc (Argument Count): An integer that holds the number of command-line arguments.
argv (Argument Vector): An array of strings that holds the actual arguments as strings.
Explain that argv[0] typically contains the program's name.
Example Programs

Provide simple code examples to illustrate how to use argv and argc:
Show how to access and print command-line arguments.
Explain how to perform basic operations on the arguments (e.g., converting to integers).
