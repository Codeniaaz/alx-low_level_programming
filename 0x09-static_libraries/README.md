Static libraries, also known as archive files, are collections of object files bundled together into a single file. They contain precompiled functions and code that can be reused in various C programs.
Creating a Static Library

Describe the process of creating a static library:
Compile individual source code files into object files (e.g., file1.o, file2.o).
Use the ar (archive) command to bundle these object files into a single static library (e.g., libexample.a).
Compiling with a Static Library

Explain how to compile a C program that uses a static library:
Use the -L flag to specify the directory containing the library.
Use the -l flag to specify the library name (e.g., -lexample for libexample.a).
This links the library's functions into your program at compile time.
Using Static Libraries in Your C Programs

Show how to include and use functions from a static library in your C program:
Include the library's header files using #include.
Call the library's functions as you would with any other function in your code.
Advantages and Disadvantages

Discuss the pros and cons of using static libraries:
Advantages:
Faster execution since code is linked at compile time.
Better code encapsulation and modularization.
Easier distribution of self-contained executables.
Disadvantages:
Larger executable size because the library code is duplicated in each executable.
Requiring recompilation if the library is updated.
Static libraries are particularly useful for organizing and reusing code across multiple projects, making them an essential tool in C programming. When you're ready, type "next," and we'll move on to the next subtopic, which is Command-Line Arguments (argv and argc).
