Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's a powerful and elegant way to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. To implement recursion in a programming language, you generally follow these steps:

Identify the base case(s): The base case is a condition under which the recursive function stops calling itself and returns a result. It's crucial to prevent infinite recursion. The base case is where the problem becomes trivial and can be solved directly.

Define the recursive case(s): The recursive case is where the function calls itself with a modified version of the problem. Each recursive call should bring the problem closer to the base case. You need to design the function such that it makes progress toward the base case.

Invoke the recursive function: Inside the function, call itself with the modified problem until the base case is reached.
