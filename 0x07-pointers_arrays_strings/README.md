I. Introduction

This project directory serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding pointers, arrays, and strings in programming.
II. Pointers

1. Overview

Pointers are variables that store memory addresses, allowing for efficient memory manipulation and dynamic data structures.
2. Pointer Types

Covers various pointer types such as integer pointers, character pointers, and function pointers.
3. Pointer Arithmetic

Explains how pointer arithmetic works, including incrementing and decrementing pointers.
4. Pointers and Arrays

Demonstrates the relationship between pointers and arrays, highlighting how arrays are internally represented as pointers.
5. Pointers and Functions

Discusses the use of pointers as function arguments and return values, enabling functions to modify data outside their scope.
III. Arrays

1. Array Basics

Defines arrays as collections of elements with the same data type, emphasizing their zero-based indexing and declaration syntax.
2. Multidimensional Arrays

Explores the concept of multidimensional arrays, including 2D arrays and arrays of arrays.
3. Dynamic Arrays

Introduces dynamic arrays, which can change in size during runtime using pointers and memory allocation.
4. Array Operations

Covers common array operations such as sorting, searching, and traversal techniques.
IV. Strings

1. Character Arrays vs. Strings

Clarifies the distinction between character arrays and strings in C/C++ and discusses null-terminated strings.
2. String Manipulation

Provides examples of string manipulation functions, including concatenation, comparison, and copying.
3. String Input and Output

Explains how to read and write strings from/to standard input/output streams.
4. String Libraries

Lists popular libraries and functions for advanced string processing, such as the C Standard Library and the C++ Standard Library.
This  directory has files that will test if you understood this concepts or not.
