A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element points to both its previous and next element in the sequence. Unlike a singly linked list, which only points to the next element, a doubly linked list allows for bidirectional traversal.

Here are some key points about doubly linked lists:

Node Structure:

Each node in a doubly linked list contains two pointers: one pointing to the previous node (or NULL for the first node) and one pointing to the next node (or NULL for the last node).
The basic structure of a doubly linked list node might look like this in C++:
cpp
Copy code
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* prev;
    Node* next;
};
Traversal:

Due to the bidirectional nature of the list, you can traverse it in both forward and backward directions.
Starting from the head or tail, you can move to the next or previous node using the respective pointers.
Insertion and Deletion:

Insertion and deletion operations are more straightforward in a doubly linked list compared to a singly linked list.
To insert a new node, you update the pointers of the neighboring nodes to include the new node.
To delete a node, you update the pointers of the neighboring nodes to bypass the node to be deleted.
Memory Overhead:

A doubly linked list requires more memory than a singly linked list due to the extra pointer for the previous node in each node.
Usage:

Doubly linked lists are used in situations where bidirectional traversal is required or when insertion and deletion operations are frequent.
Advantages:

Efficient for reverse traversal.
Insertion and deletion operations at both ends of the list are more efficient compared to a singly linked list.
Disadvantages:

Higher memory overhead compared to a singly linked list.
More complex code due to the management of two pointers for each node.
Understanding doubly linked lists is essential for implementing various data structures and algorithms efficiently. They are commonly used in scenarios where bidirectional traversal is crucial, such as in certain types of caches and memory management systems.
