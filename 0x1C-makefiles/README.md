A makefile is a file used by the "make" build automation tool in software development. It contains instructions, typically written in a special-purpose scripting language, that specify how to compile and build a software project. Makefiles define dependencies between source code files and specify the commands needed to compile them into executable programs or libraries. By using makefiles, developers can automate the build process and ensure that all necessary steps are executed in the correct order to produce the desired output.
